# Capstone Project Guidelines

The Capstone Project is your opportunity to apply and integrate the knowledge and skills gained throughout this curriculum. It challenges you to develop a tangible solution related to autonomous humanoid robotics. This document provides guidelines to help you navigate the project lifecycle effectively.

## 1. Project Ideation and Selection

Your project should address a specific problem or demonstrate a novel capability within the domain of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Consider the following areas:

*   **Perception**: Advanced object recognition, scene understanding, human gesture interpretation using VLA models.
*   **Manipulation**: Complex object handling, tool use, collaborative tasks with humans.
*   **Navigation**: Autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, path planning in dynamic environments.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction**: Intuitive communication, social cues, safety protocols.
*   **Learning**: Reinforcement learning for locomotion, adaptive control, learning from demonstration.

**Key Questions for Ideation:**
*   What problem are you trying to solve?
*   What is the desired outcome or capability of your humanoid robot?
*   Which modules from the curriculum are most relevant to your project?
*   Is the project scope manageable within the available timeframe?

## 2. Project Proposal (Due End of Week 9)

A well-structured proposal is crucial for defining your project's direction. Your proposal should include:

*   **Title**: A concise and descriptive title for your project.
*   **Problem Statement**: Clearly articulate the problem your project addresses and its significance in Physical AI/Humanoid Robotics.
*   **Project Objectives**: List specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives. What will your robot be able to do?
*   **Methodology**: Outline the technical approach you plan to take. Which ROS 2 packages, simulation tools (Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity), and AI models (NVIDIA Isaac, VLA) will you use?
*   **Deliverables**: Specify the tangible outputs of your project (e.g., simulated robot behavior, code repository, technical report, video demonstration).
*   **Timeline**: A high-level timeline indicating major milestones.
*   **Resources Required**: List any specific hardware (if applicable), software, or computational resources needed.
*   **Expected Challenges**: Identify potential technical hurdles and how you plan to mitigate them.

## 3. Design and Architecture

Before implementation, develop a high-level design for your system. This includes:

*   **System Architecture Diagram**: Illustrate the major components of your robotic system (e.g., ROS 2 nodes, AI modules, sensor inputs, actuator outputs) and their interactions.
*   **Software Design**: Outline the key software modules, classes, and functions.
*   **Data Flow**: Describe how data moves through your system, from sensor input to AI processing to actuator commands.
*   **Interface Definitions**: Define how different components will communicate (e.g., ROS 2 topics, services, actions).

## 4. Implementation and Integration

*   **Iterative Development**: Break down your project into smaller, manageable tasks. Implement and test iteratively.
*   **Version Control**: Utilize Git for version control. Regularly commit changes with clear messages.
*   **Modular Code**: Write clean, modular, and well-documented code.
*   **Simulation First**: Develop and test your algorithms in simulation (Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity) before attempting physical deployment (if applicable).
*   **Troubleshooting**: Be prepared for debugging. Leverage ROS 2 tools, logging, and visualization to diagnose issues.

## 5. Testing and Evaluation

*   **Unit Testing**: Test individual components of your code.
*   **Integration Testing**: Verify the interaction between different modules (e.g., sensor driver with a perception module).
*   **System Testing**: Evaluate the overall performance of your robotic system against your defined objectives.
*   **Performance Metrics**: Quantify your robot's capabilities (e.g., task completion rate, accuracy, latency).

## 6. Documentation and Presentation

*   **Technical Report**: Document your project's problem statement, methodology, design, implementation details, results, and conclusions.
*   **Code Documentation**: Ensure your code is well-commented and includes READMEs for easy understanding.
*   **Video Demonstration**: Prepare a video showcasing your robot's capabilities.
*   **Final Presentation**: Deliver a clear and engaging presentation to demonstrate your project and its impact.

The Capstone Project is a significant undertaking. Plan diligently, manage your time effectively, and don't hesitate to seek guidance from instructors or peers. Good luck!
