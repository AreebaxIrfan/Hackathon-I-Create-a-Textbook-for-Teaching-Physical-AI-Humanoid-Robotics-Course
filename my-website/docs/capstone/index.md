# Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid

The Capstone Project is the culmination of your journey through this curriculum. It provides an opportunity to synthesize the knowledge and skills acquired across all modules—from ROS 2 fundamentals and advanced simulation techniques to NVIDIA Isaac integration and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model development. Your objective is to design, implement, and demonstrate a significant aspect of autonomous humanoid robotics.

This project is not merely an exercise in applying learned concepts; it is a challenge to innovate, solve real-world problems, and contribute to the rapidly evolving field of physical AI. You will be encouraged to think critically, integrate diverse technologies, and troubleshoot complex robotic systems.

## Project Goals

The overarching goal of the Capstone Project is to empower you to:

*   **Integrate Multiple Technologies**: Seamlessly combine ROS 2, simulation platforms (Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity), and AI frameworks (NVIDIA Isaac, VLA models) into a cohesive robotic system.
*   **Solve a Defined Problem**: Identify a specific problem in autonomous humanoid robotics and propose a creative, technically sound solution.
*   **Demonstrate Autonomy**: Develop a humanoid robot (simulated or physical) that can perceive its environment, make intelligent decisions, and execute actions independently.
*   **Evaluate Performance**: Rigorously test and evaluate your project's performance, identifying limitations and potential improvements.
*   **Communicate Effectively**: Clearly articulate your project's goals, methodology, results, and implications through presentations and technical documentation.

## Project Scope & Flexibility

While the focus is on humanoid robotics, the specific form factor of your robot (e.g., a full humanoid, a humanoid arm, or a mobile manipulator) can be adapted based on available resources and project goals. The emphasis is on demonstrating the principles of autonomous behavior and physical AI. Projects can be entirely simulation-based, or involve integration with physical hardware if accessible.

## What to Expect

The Capstone module will guide you through the entire project lifecycle, from initial ideation and proposal development to implementation, testing, and final presentation. You will receive guidelines for project selection, proposal writing, progress reporting, and final evaluation. This is your opportunity to leave a lasting mark and showcase your expertise in the cutting-edge domain of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
