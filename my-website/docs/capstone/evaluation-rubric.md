# Capstone Project Evaluation Rubric

This rubric will be used to assess your Capstone Project, focusing on the integration of learned concepts, technical execution, problem-solving, and communication. Each criterion will be evaluated on a scale, contributing to your overall project grade.

## I. Project Proposal & Design (20%)

| Criteria                | Unsatisfactory (0-4)                  | Developing (5-6)                     | Proficient (7-8)                         | Exemplary (9-10)                                |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Definition**  | Unclear or trivial problem statement. | Problem stated but lacks depth.      | Clear problem, relevant to Physical AI.  | Compelling, well-justified problem statement.   |
| **Objectives**          | Vague objectives, not measurable.     | Objectives somewhat clear, some measurable. | Clear, measurable objectives.            | SMART objectives, highly impactful.             |
| **Methodology/Design**  | No clear approach, major flaws.       | Basic approach, some design elements missing. | Sound technical approach, clear design.    | Innovative and robust design, well-justified choices. |

## II. Technical Implementation & Integration (40%)

| Criteria                | Unsatisfactory (0-4)                  | Developing (5-6)                     | Proficient (7-8)                         | Exemplary (9-10)                                |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **ROS 2 Usage**         | Incorrect or minimal ROS 2 use.       | Basic ROS 2 functionality, some issues. | Effective use of ROS 2 (nodes, topics, services). | Advanced ROS 2 usage, efficient, well-structured. |
| **Simulation/Hardware** | No simulation/hardware, or ineffective use. | Basic simulation/hardware setup, some errors. | Effective use of simulation/hardware for testing. | Sophisticated simulation/hardware integration, robust. |
| **AI (Isaac/VLA)**      | AI components missing or poorly integrated. | Basic AI integration, limited functionality. | Effective AI integration, demonstrated capability. | Innovative AI application, highly effective.    |
| **Code Quality**        | Poorly organized, undocumented, bugs. | Functional but messy, some comments.   | Clean, modular, well-commented code.     | Exemplary code, extensible, follows best practices. |

## III. Results & Evaluation (20%)

| Criteria                | Unsatisfactory (0-4)                  | Developing (5-6)                     | Proficient (7-8)                         | Exemplary (9-10)                                |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Demonstration**       | Fails to demonstrate core functionality. | Demonstrates basic functions with issues. | Clear demonstration of core functionality. | Compelling, smooth, and robust demonstration.   |
| **Performance**         | No evaluation or poor performance.    | Limited evaluation, some metrics.      | Clear evaluation, reasonable performance.  | Rigorous evaluation, strong performance metrics.  |
| **Problem Solving**     | Unable to resolve key issues.         | Resolves basic issues, struggles with complex. | Effectively resolves technical challenges. | Proactively identifies and solves complex problems. |

## IV. Communication & Presentation (20%)

| Criteria                | Unsatisfactory (0-4)                  | Developing (5-6)                     | Proficient (7-8)                         | Exemplary (9-10)                                |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Report**    | Incomplete, unclear, many errors.     | Basic report, lacks detail/structure. | Well-structured, clear, technically accurate. | Comprehensive, insightful, professionally written. |
| **Presentation**        | Disorganized, unclear, over/under time. | Basic presentation, some clarity issues. | Clear, engaging, within time limits.      | Professional, persuasive, inspiring presentation. |
| **Q&A Response**        | Unable to answer questions.           | Struggles with some questions.       | Answers questions clearly and accurately. | Insightful, comprehensive, and confident answers. |
